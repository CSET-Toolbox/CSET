classdef opBlockOp < opSpot
%OPBLOCKOP   Blockwise application of operator on matrices.
%
%   B = opBlockOp(M,N,OPIN,BR1,BC1,BR2,BC2) creates an operator that
%   applies the given OPIN operator on two-dimensional data in a
%   blockwise fashion. In the forward mode this means that the input
%   vector is reshaped into an M-by-N matrix, which is then divided
%   into blocks of size BR1-by-BC1. Next, we apply OPIN to each
%   (vectorized) block and reshape the output to BR2-by-BC2
%   blocks. These blocks are gathered in a matrix which is vectorized
%   to give the final output. In transpose mode, the input vector is
%   reshaped into a matrix with M/BR1-by-N/BC1 blocks of size
%   BR2-by-BC2, and the conjugate transpose of OPIN is applied to each
%   block as described above to give BR1-by-BC1 blocks. These form an
%   M-by-N matrix which is vectorized for output. When omitted, BR2
%   and BC2 are respectively set to BR1 and BC1 by default.
